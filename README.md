## About project
Multirotors have gradually become one of the most widespread tools for monitoring, surveillance, imaging, rescue, transportation, and even entertainment in the last decade, but one of the big obstacles in the way of this progress is the cost of multirotors. Most of this cost is made up of the sensor and control board, and if this cost can be reduced in some way, the overall cost of the multirotor will be greatly reduced.  The solution chosen in this project is to use a smartphone. The smartphone is cheap compared to the common control boards used in multirotors and has many sensors and modules by default, so the feedback and control part can be done completely on the smartphone. The actuators part outside will include the motors and motor controller(arduino board).
